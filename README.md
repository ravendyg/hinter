### What it is

An attempt to survive an obscene affection some big companies have for abbreviations. Like:
```
- I think that BLA1 is BLA2, but should be BLA3.
- You are wrong it's BLA4 instead of BLA4
```


In order not to dissapoint security guys I cant't provide a dictionary, just an example. It's up for you to add your own `dictionary.js` with correct data.

### How it works
It's a Chrome extension that searches for matches (case sensitive), highlightes them and adds title.

### TODO
Probablly will never have time for that, but anyway:
1) Add build stage (using Rollup.js, need to learn how to use it);
2) Having done #1, add tests;
3) Learn https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_algorithm and implement a proper search algorithm.
